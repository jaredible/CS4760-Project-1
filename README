# CS4760 Project 1: Linux System Calls and Library Functions

##### ADJUSTMENTS
- removed responsibility from `sizepathfun` and instead had `depthfirstapply` be responsible (Approved by Bhatia)
- responsibility of outputting size and path are given to `sizepathfun` (Approved by Bhatia)
- the method `showtreesize` was changed to instead only be responsible for displaying the size of the directory rooted at path (Approved by Bhatia)
- added a method, `showformattedusage`, that is only responsible for outputting a size and path (Approved by Bhatia)
- added another method, `sizeoptions`, that is only responsible for getting a file's status' size in bytes or blocks (Approved by Bhatia)
- added a linked-list data structure (struct inode) to handle remembering which inodes have been visiting during DFS
- added several utility functions: `program_name`, `get_index`, `error`, `usage`, and `human_options`
- using several global variables to know of which options are enabled
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### ISSUES
- executing `./mydu -abc . mydu.c` will output mydu.c twice
- symbolic link cycles (infinite loops) not accounted for
- executing `./mydu` with a non-existant file will error a bit incorrectly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### HOW TO RUN
1. In your command promt, type: `make`
2. This will generate an object and executable file.
3. To use the program, type: `./mydu`
4. You then will see a list of directories, from your current working directory, with their block sizes.
5. For more options with this program, type: `./mydu -h`
